# Challenge

1. Use React/Redux to build a simple image slideshow
2. Do not use create-react-app, react-boilerplate, or the like
3. Do not use any third-party slideshow or image gallery components
4. Use a well-documented, public API for acquiring images (Flickr or Instagram have good ones)
5. Provide at least two sort order options
6. For initial image load and navigation (left or right), call this pixel: http://www.healthline.com/images/clear.gif
7. Assume our users are the general public and plan accordingly.  Note: you will be asked about decisions based on this, so please consider it a bit.

## Getting started
  1. ```npm install```
